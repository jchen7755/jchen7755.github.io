                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
                <p>The Apple website provides a sleek and intuitive platform for exploring their products, such as iPhones, MacBooks, and accessories. Its minimalist design is visually appealing and easy to navigate, with well-organized sections that ensure a seamless user experience. The homepage is thoughtfully structured, guiding users effortlessly to their desired products while showcasing Apple's innovation and aesthetic through high-quality visuals and clear information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent contrast between text and background, with a clean white backdrop and dark text that enhances readability. The distinct contrast between sections further aids navigation, making it easy to differentiate between product categories and featured content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Apple employs consistent layouts and design elements across sections, creating a cohesive flow. Product tiles are uniformly sized, and the navigation bar maintains a repetitive structure, enabling intuitive movement across the site. Repeated visual motifs reinforce brand identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website's alignment is precise, with elements carefully placed to create a balanced and harmonious layout. Each section aligns seamlessly with others, ensuring a polished and professional appearance that enhances usability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Strategic spacing groups related content together, clearly indicating relationships between elements. This thoughtful use of proximity supports smooth transitions between sections and prevents visual clutter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
                <p>The Craigslist website feels outdated and cluttered, making navigation challenging and the overall experience frustrating. Its design lacks structure, with a dense layout and minimal organization. The homepage overwhelms users with a barrage of text and links, offering little visual hierarchy or clear guidance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast is inconsistent, with a plain background and varying text colors that make readability difficult in some areas. There’s little distinction between sections, which hinders navigation and creates a chaotic feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repetition is minimal and poorly executed. The site repeats a basic text-heavy format, but the lack of consistent design elements or layouts results in a disjointed experience. Headers and links follow no clear pattern.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment is haphazard, with content appearing misaligned and unevenly spaced. The layout feels like an afterthought, with text and links crammed together without clear organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Content is densely packed with little spacing, making it hard to discern related items. Sections blend into one another, and the lack of clear grouping adds to the site’s cluttered and confusing nature.</li>
